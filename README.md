## 1) Print a Message

A simple program that prints a message to the console.
```bash
  Example: Hello World!
```

## 2) Print Numbers from 1 to 10

Write a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10 sequentially.
```bash
  Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

## 3) Print Numbers in Reverse

A program that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.
```bash
  Example: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
    
## 4) Print Odd Numbers Between 1 to 20

A loop that prints all the odd numbers between 1 and 20.

```bash
  Example: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
```


## 5) Reverse the Left and Right Numbers

Write a program that, given a number as input, prints the numbers in a mirrored pattern where the left half is in reverse order, and the right half is in regular order.

```bash
  Example: 
  Input: 9 → Output: 4 3 2 1 5 9 8 7 6
  Input: 13 → Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 12 11 10 9 8
```


## 6) Create a Student Class

Design a Student class with properties like name and marks. Then, create 5 student objects and store them in a suitable data structure. Calculate and display the average marks for each student.

```bash
  Example: 

  Name: Ruwini
  Average of Ruwini is: 70.66666666666667
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Hiruni
  Average of Hiruni is: 62.0
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Nazik
  Average of Nazik is: 58.0
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Janani
  Average of Janani is: 95.0

  Name: Arvin
  Average of Arvin is: 75.66666666666667
  ----------------------------------------

## 8) Retail Store Management System

Implement a system for a retail store that can store, edit, and delete multiple product types like fruits, vegetables, and groceries. The system should display available products with their name, price, and quantity. Use object-oriented programming principles to manage the product data efficiently.

```bash
  Example: 

  Products in the Store:
  Fruit: Apple | Price: 1.2 | Quantity: 100
  Vegetable: Carrot | Price: 0.5 | Quantity: 150
  Grocery: Rice | Price: 2.5 | Quantity: 50

  -----------------------------------------------
  After editing Apple:

  Products in the Store:
  Fruit: Apple | Price: 1.5 | Quantity: 120
  Vegetable: Carrot | Price: 0.5 | Quantity: 150
  Grocery: Rice | Price: 2.5 | Quantity: 50

  -----------------------------------------------
  After deleting Carrot:

  Products in the Store:
  Fruit: Apple | Price: 1.5 | Quantity: 120
  Grocery: Rice | Price: 2.5 | Quantity: 50
```
